# Hangman
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word (in this case computer), phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

In this game a collection of words contains few sports, the user can extend it with other words if he wants.
